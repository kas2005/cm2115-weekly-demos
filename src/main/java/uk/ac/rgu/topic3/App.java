/**
 * This example demonstrates concepts behind inheritance, abstract classes, and polymorphism
 * Run the examples by having this class open when you click the Run button, or click Run
 * where it has "Run | Debug" above the main() method.
 * 
 * Suggested exercises to deepen your understanding:
 * 
 * 1) Create a class representing a new type of Animal. Create an instance of this and pass it to the 
 *      acceptAnimal() method. This will illustrate how polymorphism allows existing methods to accept
 *      previously unknown types of object.
 * 
 * 2) Add some extra (non-abstract) methods to Animal. Then experiment with overriding these methods in
 *      some sub-classes but not in others.
 * 
 * 3) Extend the inheritance hierarchy further downwards by extending the Cat and/or Dog class
 *      (e.g., a Lion is a type of Cat). Explore what happens if make Cat an abstract class, and
 *      delete the implementation of makeSound().
